Program Purpose:

A user may adopt one of three randomly generated pets from a pet shop, and take care of those pets by interacting with them in an interaction menu.
The user can track the pets statistics, including health, happiness, and hunger. Each of those levels falls and rises depending what the user chooses to do.
A pet may die, and when it does, it will be removed from the users list of pets.
Pets have their own special characteristics and activities they can perform. They also have varying rates of rising and falling in their statistics.
The user's information does not get saved. Each time the program is reloaded, the user's pet list is empty.

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Encapsulation**
All of the member variables in each class are protected or private. Most methods are private in the Pet class.

**Polymorphism**
The Dog, Cat, and Fish classes are all derived from the Pet class. They have their own special overridden methods, like Playing and Feeding.

**Inheritance**
Dog, Cat, and Fish have many shared member variables in the Pet class. Each derived class has class-specific ones as well, like the dog breed or cat color.

**Abstraction**
Each class performs a different function, no class does too much or should be split reasonably further into smaller classes.
